# StdManagementSystem
CODED IN 4th Semester -> Project of DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
Tools -> Visual Studio(C#) and MS SQL SERVER for database.

I made a student Management System which has 3 main entities:
Admin - Teacher - Student

Admin has root access and can sign up as well. He can add,remove or modify Students or Teachers.

Teachers can see their profile, search his student and also can mark attendance.

Students can see their profile, attendance and enroll a course as well.

Deficiency:
	Due to shortage of time I didn't entered module of adding new course and assigning the course to teacher.
